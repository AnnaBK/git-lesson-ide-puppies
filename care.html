        <p>Learn how to take care of your puppy and provide a healthy and happy life for them.</p>
        <p>Preparing to bring home a new puppy is an exciting journey, but before you can dive into the fun, there are a few things you need to do. Here is a quick guide to help.</p>
        <h3>Prepare Your Home</h3>
        <p>Puppies are a lot like children. If there is something to get into, they’ll find it. And let’s face it: adorable puppies aren’t so adorable when they’re chewing on your favorite pair of shoes.</p>
        <p>Though you might not be able to keep everything away from them, you can limit what they’re exposed to. In addition to putting away shoes, kids’ toys, and other items you don’t want to be chewed up, be sure to lock away any chemicals and hide cords. Getting gates to block off unsafe areas can help, too. </p>
        <h3>Make a Supply Run</h3>
        <p>You don’t want to bring your puppy home without the supplies they need. At a minimum, you’ll need food as well as food and water bowls. Other items to buy include shampoo, grooming supplies, bedding, toys (to further discourage chewing on your stuff), a collar, and a leash. </p>
        <h3>Set Proper Expectations from the Start</h3>
        <p>Many people let their new pets roam free when they first bring them home and then change the rules later. Unfortunately, this can be confusing. If you allow your puppy to lounge on your furniture in the beginning, they’ll become accustomed to it.</p>
        <p>Instead, follow your rules from the start. Keep them off the furniture, have them sleep in their bed instead of yours, and so on.</p>
        <h3>Visit Your Veterinarian</h3>
        <p>It’s wise to have a veterinarian chosen before you bring your new puppy home so that you have plenty of time to research local pet care providers. As soon as you have your puppy, set up your first pet care appointment.</p>
        <p>During this appointment, they’ll not only receive a check-up but any pet vaccinations they need. These pet vaccinations are essential for their health and wellbeing, as they protect them from potentially fatal illnesses and diseases, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canine hepatitis</li>
            <li>Canine distemper</li>
            <li>Heartworm</li>
            <li>Coronavirus</li>
            <li>Kennel cough</li>
            <li>Leptospirosis</li>
            <li>Parvovirus</li>
            <li>Rabies</li>
            <li>Bordetella</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not all puppies need every vaccination, as some depend on where you live. Your veterinarian will provide the ones that your pet needs and discuss any optional ones with you. Pet care appointments also provide your veterinarian with the chance to screen for any potential health issues and provide recommendations for optimal pet care. </p>
